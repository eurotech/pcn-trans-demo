The PCN Transportation Dashboard provides a visual view of PCN based applications
associated with your Eurotech Everyware Cloud account. The dashboard is intended
to provide information on vehicle telemetry data (location, speed, etc.) and
passenger population information (passengers in, passengers out, total
passengers).

The fields in the dialog are defined as:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Account** | The Everyware Cloud account to which the dashboard will connect. |
| **Username** | The Everyware Cloud username with which the dashboard will authenticate. The user should have proper permissions to both access the APIs as well as connect to the MQTT broker. |
| **Password** | The password associated with the Everyware Cloud username. |
| **Everyware URL** | The websocket based address for the Everyware Cloud MQTT broker. The default value of ws://broker-sandbox.everyware-cloud.com:8080/ws should be used for most scenarios. |
| **API Url** | The URL of the Everyware Cloud REST APIs. The default value of https://api-sandbox.everyware-cloud.com/v2/ should be used for most scenarios. |
| **Keep me logged in** | When checked, this value will store credentials within the browser to prevent having to login multiple times. |

## Top Navigation
The navigation buttons in the top right portion of the screen support these
functions:

| Icon | Description |
|---|---|
| ![Full Screen](images/full_screen.png) | This Button enables full screen mode. |
| ![Credentials Button](images/cred_diag.png) | This button presents the credentials dialog again. |
| ![Log Out](images/log_out.png) | This button logs the current user out of the dashboard. **This feature is currently not functional**. |
| ![Nav Toggle](images/nav_toggle.png) | This button toggles the navigation elements on the left side of the web page. |
| ![Cloud Status](images/cloud_status.png) | This icon shows the current status of the connection with Everyware Cloud. |
| ![Language Button](images/lang_button.png) | **This feature is currently not functional**. Only English is supported at this time. |

## Left Navigation Live-View

The Live View section shows all gateways or simulators currently connected to the associated account which have an application ID registered that matches one of the Application Identifiers listed in the dashboardâ€™s [configuration section](#configuration).

The dashboard application may take some time to process the devices associated
with the account. While the devices are being processed, the user may see a
spinning icon. Once this icon disappears, the user can select the checkbox
associated with the device to view it on the map.

### Configuration
The configuration page allows the user to dynamically change certain settings
of the web application. Below is a listing of available settings:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Web Portal Title** | Title for the web application. |
| **Speed Units** | Units to be used when displaying vehicle speed information (mph or kph). |
| **Trail Size** | The number of GPS data points to use when displaying a trace of the vehicles route on the map. |
| **Application Identifiers** | These values correlate to a device's application identifier that is sent as part of the birth certificate when a device connects to Everyware Cloud. This value is set in either an ESF application via the [CloudService](http://download.eclipse.org/kura/docs/api/3.0.0/apidocs/org/eclipse/kura/cloud/CloudService.html) or when creating a device with the [device API](https://api-sandbox.everyware-cloud.com/docs/resource_Devices.html#path__devices.html). Application Identifiers can be edited via the text box or added/removed using the plus/minus buttons ![Plus Minus](images/plus_minus.png). The **Save Application Identifiers** button must be clicked in order to apply any changes from this section.
| **Passenger Count Topics** | These are the topics the web application subscribes to in order to gather passenger count information. For example, a device may relay passenger "In" information on the topic: `{account}/{client_id}/PCNPublisher/Bus/AbsoluteIn` </br></br> Passenger Count Topics can be edited via the text box or added/removed using the plus/minus buttons ![Plus Minus](images/plus_minus.png). The **Save Topics** button must be clicked in order to apply any changes from this section. |
| **Location Topic** | This is the topic the web application subscribes to in order to gather vehicle GPS information. The Location Topic can be edited via the text box. |
| **WS Broker URL** | The websocket based address for the Everyware Cloud MQTT broker. The default value of ws://broker-sandbox.everyware-cloud.com:8080/ws should be used for most scenarios. The **Reconnect to Everyware Cloud** button must be clicked to apply changes to this section. |
| **API URL** | The URL of the Everyware Cloud REST APIs. The default value of https://api-sandbox.everyware-cloud.com/v2/ should be used for most scenarios. The **Reconnect to Everyware Cloud** button must be clicked to apply changes to this section. |
